00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.040
in October 1997 a very small

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.920
British studio which didn't look like much,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.799
made up of only around twenty people,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.200
released a little game which was

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.520
about to change the history of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.960
video games and more  largely from the world of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.000
pop culture this game is GTA grand

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.479
deft auto a game behind its time

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.320
technically outdated

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.240
graphically with very

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.840
laborious gameplay developed by DMA design and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.639
published by BMG interactive at the time on

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.200
paper nothing  could predict a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.120
brilliant future for him but in fact

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.879
the story was already written because GTA

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.360
beyond its gameplay and its

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.440
graphics is above all a concept

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.160
that of almost limitless freedom

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
and above all GTA is a  vision

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.080
that of Sam Hauser the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280
executive producer of the title a vision not

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920
only in the video game industry

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.640
but also and more broadly in pop

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.800
culture a man who had planned everything

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.720
who had understood the codes before anyone else

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720
GTA will become one  of the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.680
biggest hits of the year 1997 the objective

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.720
was already to prepare the transition to the year

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.120
2000 with the arrival of the PS2 and in 2001

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.879
GTA 3 will mark a real turning point to the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.319
point where we can clearly say

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.480
today that  there was a before and an

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.560
after on October 26,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.120
2001 with GTA 3 the definition of freedom

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.319
took on its full meaning the power of the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.159
PS2 allowed the young teams at

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.040
Rockstar Games as well as the teams at

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.040
DMA design to design a new game

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040
in a town of Liberty City which

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.120
itself bore the name of liberty

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.879
a city inspired by New York which

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.560
allows players to run in

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.680
pursuit of the American dream starting

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.680
from the bottom of the social ladder betrayed by

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.200
your girlfriend from  era and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.280
reaching the roof of the city putting at

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120
your feet all the gangs of the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.319
city with GTA 3 Rockstar Sam and Dan

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.680
Hauser begin to create their empire and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680
their vision of the video game because yes

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.159
if today GTA is a  success it

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.319
is not for its genre the GTA Like or

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.920
now the open world action game

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.480
is not specific to GTA watch dogs

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.720
Centro driver TR cream The Getaway

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.959
Sleeping Dogs in recent years we no

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.560
longer count the number of games  of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.400
licenses and studios which were

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
inspired by GTA but none

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.640
came close to matching Rockstar even

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.519
if some were serious Rivau

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.360
because GTA is much more than a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.480
simple game it is a vision that of

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.599
Sam and Danuser but also that of Aaron

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.920
garbut of Jamie King of Terry Donovan of

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.200
Lesli Benzis of Gary Forman of Jennifer

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.400
Colby or even of Laslow Jones and many

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.280
other people in the early

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.680
2000s Rockstar is

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.439
preparing its future with

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.320
very important people who join the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.478
teams of people with the same

00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:22.199
vision the same desire to offer

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.240
much more than a video game this vision

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.040
and this desire to leave behind the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.880
clichés of the nice little plumber who

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.199
saves his princess or the blue sound who

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.039
are running at full speed, Rockstar's vision

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.680
is to show that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.000
video games are a mature medium not only

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.680
for children but also for

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.880
adults and that on top of that,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.360
video games have even more

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.440
possibilities than  the world of music

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.280
or cinema Rockstar Games wants to

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.039
revolutionize the world of video games and the

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.960
entertainment industry which

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.199
will subsequently become pop culture and

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.840
for this they will use GTA but

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.960
of course at that time everything  the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.759
world laughed in the face of the Hauser brothers

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.120
and their teams since 2002 Rockstar

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.240
Games and now Rockstar nors

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.160
just renamed replacing DMA

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.240
design are back even stronger

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.720
than ever with GTA Vice City and since

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.000
Rockstar's vision is to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.320
compete and compete with cinema

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.160
why not take strong inspiration from it

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.080
Vice City it's a real

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.880
love letter to Scarface but in the GTA version

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.319
go to the 80s to the rhythm

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.880
of its iconic where Michael Jackson Talk

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.319
Talk Lionel Richie  or even The Buggles

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.720
perform on the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.199
many radio stations in the game. Vice

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.600
City is a caricature of Miami and

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.039
Tommy Verchti, brilliantly played by the

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.759
late Reliota, is a

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.440
high-class Tony Montana if GTA 3 offered

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.600
a lot of new features and freedom it

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.240
missing a reinforced concrete scenario GTA in

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.639
VI City offers us this scenario and this

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.880
narration of high quality the game

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.000
outclasses GTA 3 and becomes a

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.240
global success which will shake up

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.319
the industry but Rockstar does not intend to

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.560
stop here and leave it to  whoever

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.080
it is 2 years later GTA San

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.960
Andreas arrives and literally

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.360
explodes all records on PS2 it is

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.800
quite simply the best-selling game in

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.479
the history of the console the ultimate game

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.360
with a scenario a cast a map and

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.880
almost perfect missions the game

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.240
without limits with an innumerable number

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.560
of activities to do more than ever

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.400
Rockstar is in the process of making a success of its

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.840
Paris and the world of video games is starting

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.759
to realize it unfortunately in 2004 there is

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.240
still a lot of work  to do

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.800
in society more than ever Rockstar

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.759
and GTA are contested and bathed in

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.639
numerous controversies with the

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.120
first GTA Rockstar had bet everything on

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.120
the controversy to make people talk and sell

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.199
its game it had worked but in 1997

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.000
and until 2001 the only  goal of GTA

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.120
was to wander around without any real objective

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.919
except to create the biggest chaos and

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.160
kill as many people as possible a

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.520
not very flattering portrait 7 years later

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.160
things have changed a lot but the

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.520
media, society and the  public opinion

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.720
remained stuck on that these people

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.680
really decided to open their

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.039
minds did not take the time to

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.000
discover the new GTA and to see

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.960
the evolution of the series to see how

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.960
this simple outdated game technically

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.199
outdated in its gameplay with  no

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.759
real goal is writing

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.120
history in just 7 years and three

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.360
games GTA has become a true

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.240
satirical cultural work allowing us to

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.360
denounce our society and especially the

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.759
tragic events of our past GTA

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.280
San Andreas it is an important game

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.080
highlighting  depicts corruption and

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.400
anti-black violence in the 90s

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.639
with GTA Rockstar leaves the

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.440
most total freedom to the players but Rockstar

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.840
also sends subtle

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.039
messages and denounces many things

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.280
unfortunately the H coffee affair will not

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.639
help to restore the pain  the image of GTA despite

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.000
that Rockstar teek2 the Hauser brothers and

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.159
the GTA license does not sink and comes out

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.919
even stronger the team of the

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.639
Hauser brothers is beaten by the waves but does

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.960
not sink Rockstar will be battered by

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.520
numerous lawsuits whether from  part

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.319
of political consumer association

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.720
and even members of

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.479
the video game industry this

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.360
stormy period will inevitably have damage

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.800
with numerous departures such as those of

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.000
Jamie King Terry Donovan or even Gary

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.919
Forman of the founding members of the

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.120
star-studded firm but  Rockstar held on and

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.360
in 2008 the star-studded firm took its

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.840
revenge with GTA 4 and here again the

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.800
Hauser brothers took another step

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.440
towards their goal GTA4 is more beautiful and

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.599
more realistic than ever, getting

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.560
a little closer to cinema, the game is a

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.080
global phenomenon and begins to

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.639
affect the world of pop culture

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:25.840
pushing Marvel Studios to postpone the

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.560
release of their new production the

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.879
first opus of Iron Man by a week

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.319
so as not to end up in

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.080
cinemas the same week as the  release

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.599
of GTA 4 the media, politicians and

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.640
associations are in rage and

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.080
continue their anti-

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.000
video game and anti-rockstar policy but at this

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.880
time the starred firm and teekou

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.959
are laughing and will even win the cases

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.680
by the dozens because they are within the

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.560
legality and freedom of  the expression

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.320
allows them to do all that after all GTA

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.399
has evolved it is more than ever a

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.800
cultural work which tells a

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.720
satirical story Rockstar we finished with the

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.760
past of the 80s the 90s

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.560
now mant GTA takes place in the

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.600
2010s and  we denounce the

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.920
glassy lawyers the corrupt politicians we

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.800
even display them in our game we denounce

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.399
this desire to chain freedom

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.120
of expression in 2008 after the release of

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.360
GTA 4 Rockstar is preparing to go to

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.040
the roof of the world just before the release

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.519
of  this new opus the star farm

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:18.040
shines with portable consoles

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.240
with GTA Liberty City stouries and GTA

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.079
Vice City stouries becoming the two

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:23.519
best-selling games in the history of the

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:26.120
PSP Rockstar had just launched the rage

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.279
its graphics engine with countless

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.120
licenses  successful ones emerged like

Max pain after the release of GTA 4

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.240
Rockstar was about to drive

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.800
the point home episode from Liberty City redad

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.480
then  GTA 5 will be the culmination of 15

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.440
years of work the culmination of

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.480
Rockstar after around fifty games

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.040
around twenty licenses and

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.800
millions of titles sold in March 2014

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.200
Rockstar achieves its goal they

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.079
changed the world of pop culture gaming

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:11.000
video is recognized and proves that it can

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.320
rise to the height and even surpass

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.519
cinema in this month of March 2014

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.160
Rockstar receives the honorary prize to

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.760
reward them for their entire

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.880
career by the prestigious

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.360
BAFTA academy the mission  had just been

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.640
accomplished for the Hauser brothers

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.279
almost 10 years later the face of

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.240
Rockstar has changed a lot and that of

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.000
pop culture video games also the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.680
face of our company has also come a

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.360
long way and not necessarily

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.040
in a good way.  term 9 years after

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.839
the Baftas Rockstar only released one

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:40.320
game Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018 which

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.800
was certainly excellent but which is not

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.839
enough to satisfy fans who are

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.240
nostalgic for this period when

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000
Rockstar offered them a great

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.480
classic per year  9 years later no

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.000
GTA has succeeded the GTA V phenomenon which

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.959
now culminates at more than 190 million

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.880
games sold.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.440
Fans have been waiting for this next

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.120
GTA for 10 years and in 10 years things have evolved so much

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.519
and the wait is  so great that the

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.079
pressure is immense on the shoulders of

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:07.399
Rockstar which has lost a lot along the way

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.399
because yes we have perhaps just experienced

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.040
the most delicate 10 years of the star-

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.399
studded firm and things could

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:15.040
well be even more difficult in

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.360
the years to come.  come and if the expectations

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.600
were simply already too

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.079
high for this next

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.399
[Music]

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.070
GTA

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.369
[Music]

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.120
October 19, 2012 GTA V was announced

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.760
less than a year ago we only

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.279
had one trailer at the time and

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:45.240
some images Rockstar preparing to

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.000
offer us the second trailer of its game

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.720
and the first preview via

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.519
Game Informer magazine it is on this day that the

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.480
young studio CD project announces its

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.680
new game cyberpunk 2077 since the

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.480
rise of video games

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.279
many games have been awaited

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.040
for many years only to

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.920
end up being damp squibs

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.279
and disappointing fans, gamers and

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.160
journalists around the world but the

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.000
cyberpunk case remains very special

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.839
first of all because this case remains

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:12.600
relatively recent dating  only

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.000
3 years old but also and above all because

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.079
cyberpunk 2077 was undoubtedly one of the

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.839
most anticipated games of recent

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.800
years, a double feat when we

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.680
think that it was also

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.040
a new license.  is why

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.959
cyberpunk is the perfect example to

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.760
express our fears about the next

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.760
GTA founded in 1994 CD project was not

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.440
at all a video game developer

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.519
originally this Polish company is

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.560
historically the very first publisher

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.519
on the Polish software market  of

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.279
CDROM to put it simply CD Project was

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:46.560
as important as the CEL, the union

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.279
of publishers and leisure software

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.760
in France and therefore it was through CD project

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.360
that publishers used from the mid-

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.040
90s to edit and translate

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.320
their games on the  Polish soil thanks to CD

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.040
project Polish players have had

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.760
access to many important games

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.160
fully translated into Polish such as

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.000
the very first opus of Baldur gate in

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.360
1998 for example little by little CD project will

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.399
expand its empire becoming from the beginning

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.120
of the 2000s  the largest

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.959
distributor and publisher of video games

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.120
in Central Europe, especially on PC and

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.399
this is also when the

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.360
studio will want to expand its horizons

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360
in 2002 while the studio is not

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.519
yet 10 years old CD project will  create its

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.320
development section and launch

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.040
production of its first game The

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.240
Witcher a title which will be adapted from the

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.360
eponymous novel by Andre Samkowski released in

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.680
2007 on PC The Witcher is a success

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.920
garnering a metacritic average of 86

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.800
% which is quite impressive for

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.880
a new license and especially as

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.560
the first game from a new

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.399
development studio following the momentum of this great

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:47.120
success CD project continues but slows down

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.839
the publishing and distribution of

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:51.000
video games and begins to mobilize all its

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800
teams on the production of The  Witcher

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.519
2 4 years later the game arrives on PC

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.639
and a completely redesigned version

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:00.800
will arrive in April 2012 on Xbox 360 the

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.920
studio is already starting to leave its

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.880
comfort zone offering its first games

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.360
on console and here again success is

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.360
there  The Witcher 2 is even

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.519
better received than the first opus, garnering

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.279
a score of 88% on metacritic more

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:16.320
than ever CD project is

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.360
booming and the production of The Witcher 3

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360
begins a few months after the release of the

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.440
second game only 10 years after the

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.600
creation of the development studio CD

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.880
Project is already the author of two successful games

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.079
with a license destined to become

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:31.639
cult in May 2012 after the release and

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:34.079
success of The Witcher 2 CD project

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:36.320
formalizes during the 3rd that a new

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.720
game and a new  license are in

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.040
development in the cyberpunk theme you

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.560
will then have to wait 5 months and

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.399
October 19 to have the right to the first

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.880
teaser with the officialization of the name

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.199
cyberpunk 2077 2 months later at the very

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:51.800
beginning of the year 2013 and more

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.440
precisely on the 10  January 2013 CD

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.160
project begins the cyberpunk marketing campaign

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.720
with a first teaser, a

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.440
2-minute video which clearly lays

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.199
the foundations making us understand that the

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:04.120
game was going to immerse us in a

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.519
Blade Runner-style world with a future where sex

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:08.440
and body modifications  are

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.680
omnipresent with a good dose of

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.000
violence an enigmatic teaser which

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.160
ends with this rather funny SAÉ 10 years

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
later we see the logo of the game and

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.880
Cid project ends its video by

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.079
announcing that the title will arrive and

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.600
when it will be ready only 7  days

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.519
later the communication continues

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.639
with a new video mant forward

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.920
Mike pon Smith the designer of the

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.560
role-playing game cyberpunk 2020 who participates in

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.399
the adaptation of his work into a video game

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:37.639
because here again CD project is inspired by a

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.959
support already  existing to adapt it into a

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.079
video game this 4 minute video

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:44.160
allows Mike pon Smith to speak and

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.399
explain the world of cyberpunk in order

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.319
to tease players about all the things

00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:50.279
that will await them in this future game

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.720
and after that radiant silence during

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.360
more than 5 years CD project no longer addresses

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.199
cyberpunk 2077 and in reality it doesn't

00:15:58.199 --> 00:15:59.880
matter because at that time this

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.319
series of announcements went a little

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:04.120
unnoticed because yes in 2013 CD project

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.000
remains a young studio which has  only 10

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
years old and which has only released two games and

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.519
although the latter are of quality

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.519
and have met with great success

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.240
they have not yet marked the

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.600
video game industry on top of that The Witcher

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.680
remains a  well apart from not yet

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.759
very fashionable and a little in the shadow

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:22.000
of a certain Skyrim released the same year

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.920
as The Witcher 2 the studio has again

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.040
approved everything to break through and rise to

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.519
the height of the greatest and to

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.920
generate a  total interest on all

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.800
of its projects and especially on a

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.319
new license thus from 2013 to 2015 CD

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:37.240
project is fully invested in the

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.399
development of The Witcher 3 leaving

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:42.639
aside cyberpunk therefore in 2013

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.600
it is a tiny base of  fans who

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.000
continue to wait for this new

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.800
license which was announced

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.319
more than a year ago, it is really during

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:51.360
the year 2015 that things will

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.800
start to accelerate for CD project

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:24.199
[Music]

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:26.599
with the release of The Witcher 3 the

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.520
popularity of C project exploded

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.799
in addition to the fact that the

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.200
promotional campaign for the title was

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.240
perfectly mastered with each video

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.240
which was a mastercl giving

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.919
players more and more desire to  put your

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:39.559
hands on the game and discover the

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.640
incredible world of The Witcher 3 and the

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.520
new adventures of Gérald de Rive

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.120
we can also talk about the quality of the

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.799
title of its missions of its narration of

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.799
its completely crazy staging and

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.840
the incredible  immersion in this

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.240
sumptuous world in all aspects CD

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.200
project achieves almost faultless

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.200
and if this code of popularity has continued

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.559
to rise throughout the marketing campaign

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:01.840
it will still reach

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.840
new heights with the release of the game

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.080
and in particular  the simple edition of the title

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.320
offered at the base price of €70 at

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.880
the time but which clearly had

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.640
the appearance of a special edition map in

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.960
physics soundtrack of the game again in

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.919
physics message of thanks from the

00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:19.840
CD project teams stickers delivered

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.840
presentation of the world The Witcher 3

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.080
this simple edition was even more

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.520
complete than certain

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.600
special editions of competing games so of

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.880
course the 3 is not perfect either

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.640
hence the fact that we are talking about almost

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.760
flawless because  yes the first

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.280
versions of the game when it was released

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.240
were quite buggy but at that

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.159
time it was not a big deal because after

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:41.360
all even if Cid Project was on a

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.760
very upward slope it still remained

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.600
modest with only one license and

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.960
three  games and only 13 years

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.559
of existence so we forgive the bugs

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:51.200
although numerous it was not

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.080
catastrophic either and the game will be quickly

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.200
repaired and stable after a few weeks

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.320
of updating on top of that CD project

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.480
does not release anything and  even intends

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.520
to drive the point home 5 months later with

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.799
the release of Earth of Stone, the first

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.720
major expansion of the game which turns out

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.360
to be of very high quality. The

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.880
studio's popularity continues to

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.039
skyrocket and CD project

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:14.000
very quickly becomes a  studio increasingly

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.600
respected and appreciated and again

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.919
it was far from finished on May 31,

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:21.799
2016, 1 year after the release of the game CD

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:23.720
project dealt the fatal blow with blood

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.840
and wine considered one of the

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.720
best extensions of  air PS4 Xbox

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.320
one a DLC which will surpass the first

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.880
extension released in October 2015 but

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.320
which will perfectly close the arc of

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.120
Witcher 3 with the release of this

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.240
extension CD Project is in an

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.240
extremely positive dynamic with

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.960
many players and fans comparing the

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.039
treatment of The Witcher 3 to that of

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:49.080
GTA 4, a game already very good on paper

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.840
which is wonderfully completed with

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.559
the release of two excellent

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:55.600
additional content sold at an extremely

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.120
fair price compared to what is on

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.799
the market.  This is the moment that

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.240
many players and fans will begin

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.559
to qualify CD project as

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.720
European Rockstar and even in the press the

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.280
parallel between the two studios will

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.120
become more and more frequent in a

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.120
very short time. CD project had done

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.039
what  'it was necessary to reach a very

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.880
high level to the point of being compared to

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.520
Rockstar Games now there was

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.039
only one thing left for the Polish studio to

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:21.120
transform

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.780
[Music]

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.159
the test place am

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.009
[Music]

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.320
2 years after the release of  latest DLC of

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.120
The Witcher 3 CD Project is back

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.000
during the 3 2018 the studio reveals a

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.280
first preview of cyberpunk 2077 during

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.039
the Xbox conference and the hype is

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:57.159
unprecedented for a new license and

00:20:57.159 --> 00:20:58.679
here again it must be said that the announcement  is

00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:00.799
perfect many rumors announced

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:03.320
a return of CD project and cyberpunk

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.120
during this Xbox conference which is

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.559
why the trailer is shown at the very

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.200
end of the show after the closing message

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.799
from Phil Spencer as if CD project

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:15.200
had hacked the conference the trailer

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.440
begins in a strange atmosphere and in

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.080
the chat many players

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.559
refer to watch dogs 3 nobody or

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.880
very few players think that it is

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.279
cyberpunk and as soon as the

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:28.960
CD project mençon appears the Microsoft

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.960
theater room exults in a trailer for  a minute 40

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.400
which will set the Internet on fire with its quality

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.919
and its rhythm no release date but

00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:39.159
the expectation is already extremely high on

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:41.279
the part of the players much more than during

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:42.840
the very first announcement of the game in

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.679
2012 it must be said that in 6  years the studio

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.360
has come a long way a year

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.919
later the new trailer for

00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:51.400
cyberpunk 2077 is revealed and

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.840
once again during the 3 2019 during the

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.159
Xbox conference a much longer trailer

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:58.200
of 4 minutes this time with

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.159
a certain Ken Reeves in  guest the

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:02.320
collector's editions of the game are revealed

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.960
with a release date of April 16, 2020

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.080
on PC PS4 and Xbox one and from this

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.720
moment the hype and anticipation around

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.799
cyberpunk will take on a

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:15.000
completely crazy scale worthy of a brand

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.880
new Rockstar game  or a new opus

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.360
of a very well-known license CD project

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.159
is confident and everything seems to

00:22:21.159 --> 00:22:22.720
promise us a historic game during

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.400
this 3 2019 one-hour demos are

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.400
shown to the specialized press and

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.159
indeed the game looks  quite

00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:30.559
impressive, communication

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:32.679
is accelerating CD project and cyberpunk

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:34.440
are making presentations at

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.200
trade shows like Gamescom and Paris MS

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.480
week at the end of 2019, everything

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.360
seems to be progressing on the right path

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.440
just 4 months before the game's release this

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.159
that no one knew is that in reality

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:45.840
all this was only one facet and that

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.679
the development of cyberpunk 2077 was

00:22:48.679 --> 00:22:50.640
an unspeakable hell for the developers

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.320
the studio would even be on the verge of

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.120
breaking up with teams forced

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.400
to continue  many hours of

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.120
work with unacceptable working conditions

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.400
table weekend included the

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.799
situation is so delicate that a

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.640
first postponement of the game is announced in

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.080
January 2020 expected for April 16

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.919
cyberpunk is now expected for

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:10.200
September 17, 2020, i.e. the day of the 7  years

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.120
of a certain GTA V but this postponement

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.559
does not help anything internally the teams

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.279
are pushed to the limit the development

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:18.159
of the PS4 and Xbox one versions are an

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:19.919
ordeal which is causing

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:21.679
the entire project to fall behind schedule the

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.600
covid-19 pandemic  and teleworking will not

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.559
help anything, on the contrary, however,

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.320
management continues to make a

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.039
very confident and very assured aggressive tion

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.919
around the game in June 2020 following

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:34.559
the cancellation of the 3 and the establishment

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.480
of the Summer game Fest CD project presents

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.760
new cyberpunk gameplay sequences

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.360
and again everything seems to be

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.919
perfect even if among some

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.400
journalists doubts are starting to

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.240
remain while the NextGen consoles

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.840
had just been announced and their

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.679
release was expected for November 2020

00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:50.240
it was becoming quite difficult to believe that

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.159
the sequences presented in cyberpk

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:54.799
2077 are indeed running on PS4 Xbox

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:57.240
one, however the management of CD project

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.000
is once again very confident

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.679
and confirms that the development of the game is

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:02.760
progressing well and that the latter is expected

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.039
on PS4 Xbox one with versions to be released.  the

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:07.760
height of expectations despite this CD

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.600
project once again postpones the game

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.000
to November 2020, i.e. additional months of

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.159
postponement and here again the

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:16.640
situation does not improve, even worse

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.600
the production falls into

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.640
total chaos internally the developers

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.159
continue even more hours of

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:24.120
work the game is once again

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.640
postponed to December 10, 2020 and the

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.120
shareholders are starting to lose

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.919
patience death threats are received

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:31.600
by certain developers from

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.360
psychopathic players who do not agree to

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.640
wait any longer  for a long time CD Project has been

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.559
completely overwhelmed by events

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.919
and things are getting worse day after day

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.240
unfortunately the feedback on the

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.559
concerns is not listened to by the

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:44.360
management which does as it pleases over

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.039
the weeks the developers are

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:47.520
now certain that the  game will not be

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.640
ready even for December 10 and

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.039
faced with this warning from

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.440
the developers and

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.919
production teams, CD project management

00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:56.600
responds that they have no choice and that

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.000
the developers must finish

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.840
the game  at time on the side of the press and

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.279
players the concern is

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:03.360
growing but CD project does

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.399
not flinch the Polish publisher and developers

00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:06.919
continue to reassure

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:08.919
everyone by reassuring that all the

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:10.600
promises made by the studio since

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.080
2018  will be respected both in

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.080
terms of functionality and content

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.799
present in the game but also in

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.240
terms of performance on all

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.559
media to assure players the

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.799
press investors City project

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.840
is releasing a gameplay video on November 24

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.320
showing passages from the

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.880
PS4 versions  pro and ps5 in

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.840
backward compatible version these demos were

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.200
unfortunately not real time and

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.480
carefully prepared in advance to

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.880
offer a very good communication move about

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.600
ten days before the release of the

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.919
game the truth is that internally

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:42.080
everyone knew  that the launch of

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.360
cyberpunk 2077 was going to be a

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.600
gigantic fiasco concerning the press

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.200
the test proposals were

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.360
sent at the end of October and

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.880
then without warning CD project sent

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.960
only PC keys even to the

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.360
editorial staff who had requested

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.320
PS4 codes  or Xbox one thus on December 1st

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.640
most journalists from around the world

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.399
receive their keys on PC with

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:04.279
the ban on carrying out tests on

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.360
console before the release of the game on

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.840
December 10th and obviously this decision was

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.679
not taken at random 10 days

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:12.720
later on December 10, 2020 from the

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.440
first minutes of the game being put online

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.080
it is unprecedented chaos the

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.240
most anticipated game of the year 2020 but even

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.480
more widely of the PS4 Xbox

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.840
one generation and the biggest damp squib of

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.640
in recent years very few

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.039
promises have been kept the game and empty

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:30.159
with streets of Night City desert

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:32.039
completely scandalous bugs making it

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:34.279
impossible to progress in game and

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:36.000
making the consoles of the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
PS4 Xbox one versions simply

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.720
unplayable for the majority of

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.080
players  PS5 and Xbox series

00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.480
to the press to make the

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.320
game barely playable with a

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.320
NASA configuration at the time of its

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.480
release many features and

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.000
content are absent such as the

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.600
possibility of being able to buy

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.440
houses, hideouts and so on

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.200
being able to take the metro despite

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.120
rave reviews  of the Press who

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.080
had the privilege of testing the game on

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.960
PCs that most normal players

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.360
could not afford. Cyberpunk is a

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.159
disaster and in the face of the scolding of

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:23.440
players and certain journalists

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.520
with a good conscience having refused the

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.760
tests on PC of  cyberpunk 77 new

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.159
tests are released on PS4 and Xbox one and

00:27:31.159 --> 00:27:33.399
this time the notes are deplorable

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:35.080
the opinions of the players on Steam and the

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.279
Playstation and Xbox stores are just

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.480
as bad the world of CD Project is

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.120
collapsing whether it is the

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.720
players the fans the press but

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.679
also the investors everyone

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:46.279
feels betrayed by the studio which

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:48.399
admits to having lied the

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:50.000
stock price of CD Project is

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.159
divided by 20%.  the developers of the

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:54.320
studio, totally revolted, turned

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.960
against the management, accusing them of

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.000
having warned them for many

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.760
weeks and threatened to file a

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.320
collective complaint on their part. The

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.720
investors did not wait and

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.679
filed a collective complaint on

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:07.360
December 25, Christmas Day, thus reproaching  to

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.880
CD project false advertising

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.000
aimed at deceiving the consumer according to

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.919
investors the Polish studio

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.440
should have warned its customers

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.240
against buggy versions and not

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.360
hide it with fake trailers for the

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.480
first time in their history Sony and

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.320
Microsoft authorize the requests

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.240
refund without even needing

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.200
justification on the PlayStation Store

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.399
and the Xbox Store on PS4 and PS5 the game

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.519
will even be removed from the PlayStation Store

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:34.440
as long as CD project is not able

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.799
to offer the PlayStation consumer

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:39.279
functional versions in total these are

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.440
more  of 5 million refunds which

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.120
will be requested in a few days a

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.120
sad record had just been broken by CD

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.200
project in such a short time while

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.360
many media players and fans compared

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.240
CD project red by naming them the

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.399
European Rockstar Games several

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.120
media and players  are now comparing

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.080
cyberpunk 2070 17 as the

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.640
video game Titanic to image the incredible

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.919
shipwreck of the game at the start of 2021 the storm

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.640
is not calming for CD project

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.200
new complaints are being filed via

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.200
class actions by

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.080
consumer associations who feel betrayed

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.919
in particular by the promises  from the studio for

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:15.440
its part the management

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.919
apologizes to the players and the

00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:18.480
members of its studio promising to

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.200
repair all these errors and as

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.799
quickly as possible without resorting to

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:24.440
crunch the PS5 and Xbox series X versions

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.440
are postponed just like the big solo DLC

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.600
several small updates of

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.919
free content will be announced but the

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:32.880
damage seems to be done on the side of the players

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.840
who are not decided to forgive any

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.880
time soon after this unprecedented fiasco CD

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.760
project red must rebuild itself and

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.799
win back the hearts of the players the studio

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:43.679
is recovering  at work being very

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.480
discreet and offering numerous

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.399
updates over the months to repair the

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:49.399
game the nexGen versions are falling even

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:51.120
further behind just like that of The

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.720
Witcher 3 the solo DLC is also

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.720
falling behind the studio's only priority

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.559
from now on  is to offer

00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:00.880
stable PS4 Xbox one and PC versions objective which

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.240
will never be achieved by CD project

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.480
of course cyberpunk 2077 is

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.120
today accessible in a

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.200
suitable state compared to launch but

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.440
the PS4 and Xbox one versions

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.799
still suffer from problems and problems.  persistent bugs

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:15.480
which are no longer as annoying as at

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.159
launch which no longer make the

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:19.240
consoles spit but which are far from making the

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.919
game as beautiful and perfect as it

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.960
should have been on PC the game is doing much

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.600
better despite still a few small ones  bugs

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.559
in February 2022 CD project on offici

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.799
the PS5 and Xbox series

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.200
not having on

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.120
a recent game and even less on a

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.720
port the redemption is long and

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.240
difficult for the Polish studio we

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.480
will have to wait until September 2022 for

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.799
CD project to finally be able to have the right to

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:52.720
a big Boulder

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.240
Fry

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:14.480
announced in June 2020 during the Night City

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.559
wire  of the Summer Game Fest the

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.120
Netflix series will come and save

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.360
CD project's furniture the series is of high

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.720
quality and will be extremely well received by

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.760
spectators

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.360
immediately reviving the hype around

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.720
cyberpunk and moreover sales of the

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.600
game are soaring and  this time although

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.159
the PS5 Xbox series

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.880
following

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.720
cyberpunk 2077 and confirms that the

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.679
solo DLC is on track to arrive in

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.760
2023 a little earlier in this year

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.039
2022 CD project had formalized the

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:55.360
development of a new opus of The

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.559
Witcher everything finally seemed to be getting back

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:59.120
on the right path for the

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.720
Polish studio in April 2023 the

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.960
consoes versions of cyberpunk 2077 are entitled to

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.279
a big update allowing to

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:07.039
correct many more bugs and

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.919
technical problems thus improving the

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:10.880
stability and the visual and

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.760
graphic rendering of the game the PC version will be

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.240
entitled to this  same update a few

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.120
weeks later in June on

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.519
September 26, 2023 a final update

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.519
is put online at the same time as the

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:22.600
release of the Phantom Liberty DLC with

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.480
actor Idriss Elba and this time

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.240
feedback from the press from players and

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.279
fans are unanimous this is the

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.919
ultimate version of cyberpunk 2077

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:34.159
offering solid content with very

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:35.960
few technical and graphic issues

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.919
almost 3 years after the release of the

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.320
first version of the game but in reality

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.639
it is December 5, 2023 that  the

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:45.960
ultimate version of cyberpunk 2077 arrives on PC

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.639
ps5 and Xbox series

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.840
things for free like

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.320
new motorcycles the arrival of a

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.399
new metro network and much

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:07.799
more to definitively close this

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:10.159
chapter on a good note far from having

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:12.039
forgotten the players forgive CD

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:14.039
project and now the studio has all

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:15.399
the cards in place  hand to catch up

00:33:15.399 --> 00:33:17.639
as it should with The Witcher 4

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:20.000
as well as the sequel to cyberpunk

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.399
2077 if today we compare CD

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:24.720
project and cyberpunk 2077 to Rockstar

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.320
Games and the next GTA it is not at

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.840
first because CD

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.760
Project has quickly become a

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.840
respected studio among the biggest to the point

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.440
of being named by many players and

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.919
media the European Rockstar Games

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:39.360
on the other hand the wait for cyberpunk of

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.720
course reminds us of the

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.000
even greater disproportionate wait for this

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.320
next opus of GTA and it is clear that

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.720
very few games or even no game

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.159
was as anticipated as cyberpunk 2077

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:53.120
before the arrival of this next GTA but

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.679
finally quite simply because in

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:56.600
recent years a lot of things at

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.080
ro Star Games are starting to  remind us of

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.880
the same worries that there were at CD

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.639
project if the cyberpunk 2077 affair

00:34:03.639 --> 00:34:05.200
was a carnage it is quite simply

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
because CD project did not know how to manage the

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.239
pressure and this completely

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.480
crazy wait around the game afterwards  12 years of

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.159
receiving only good reviews which

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.040
led to a series of missteps, the studio

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.679
felt itself growing wings and was unable

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.560
to manage all of this well and from

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.520
Rockstar's side let's be realistic

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.359
this pressure must still be there

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:23.879
again  the bigger it must be

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:26.119
almost stratospheric this pressure

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.800
because imagine yourself you

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.320
are the studio which released GTA V to be the

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.760
most profitable cultural product in

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.000
history more profitable than the

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.800
latest Star Wars films more profitable

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.119
than Harry Potter or  the signur of the

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:38.280
rings you are the firm which has sold

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.199
nearly 200 million copies of your

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.520
game only on PC and console without

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.399
any mobile version sold at Rabé

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.800
you are the studio which has created over

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.679
the years much more than a video game  a

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.359
true cultural phenomenon whose

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.760
sequel has now been awaited for more

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.960
than 10 years and this is the first time in

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.879
history that this has happened so of course

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:56.560
Rockstar is not a CD project

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.839
and of course Rockstar has

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.240
experience  much more than CD project

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.359
unfortunately over the last 8 years

00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:03.760
things have changed a lot within

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.800
the star-studded firm and from the release of GTA

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.359
V and the BAFTA Awards in 2014 no one

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:10.040
suspected but things were

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.960
already turning around  interim in

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.680
January 2016 after a year of

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.839
sabbatical Lesli Benzis abandons

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:17.520
ship we learn 3 months later that

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.160
Lesle Benzis filed a complaint against

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.280
Teeku Trelnick and Sam Hauser for abuse

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.200
of power manipulation and

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.240
unpaid royalties accusing Rockstar and Teekou of

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.760
simply having it  push towards the

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.520
exit without leaving him too much choice

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.599
from 2018 tensions between Rockstar and

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.160
teekou begin to emerge between the

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.599
two fmes no longer really having the

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:37.000
same desires and the same visions teekou

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.800
being the businessman ro in the

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.359
creative side more and more  conflicts

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:41.839
of interest begin to strain both

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.320
parties tensions which will not

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.880
help during the development of redad

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.680
Redemption 2 where Rockstar wanted to

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.880
concentrate on the development of the

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.000
single player part and tackle the multiplayer

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.720
afterwards in order to offer

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.720
something  unique and not just a GTA

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.599
online Wild West version but it was

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.000
not really to Tech2's taste according to

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.800
several rumors in the corridor the idea of

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.480
releasing a single-player version of

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.560
Red Dead Redemption 2 was considered

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.359
by Rockstar in order to offer a

00:36:04.359 --> 00:36:06.480
lone stand  multiplayer of Red Dead online

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.240
later decision which will not please at all

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.280
teekou who found that there was

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.760
no point in releasing a single-player

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.319
only game in 2018 and it was a bit

00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:15.880
in haste that an online mode

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.920
was developed  in less than a year and a

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.200
half to offer a beta of Red Dead

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.319
online at the end of November 2018

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:23.880
a beta of Red Dead online which will

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.160
turn out to be in fact only a GTA online

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.000
off far W with much fewer

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.760
possibilities and  much less

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.480
game mode a failed launch which will

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.680
unfortunately never be caught up by

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.560
Rockstar while the star firm was

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.319
very discreet on the online of

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.200
redhead only realizing moments of

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.960
com around redhead Redemption 2

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.920
stroselnick the CEO of tech to

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.480
interactive  did not go out of its way

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.160
to promote the

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.200
online mode of the next Red Dead,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.760
not hesitating to announce to investors as well

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.520
as during its interviews that Rockstar

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.280
was going to offer something new

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.760
and exceptional never before seen with  this

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.079
new online mode the concern is that

00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:58.839
what was originally planned cannot

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:00.640
be achieved with such

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.160
short deadlines after the release of the game the

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.800
launch of the Red Dead online beta

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.960
at the beginning of 2019 l  The atmosphere

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.280
is not at its highest level at

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.560
Rockstar, especially since the studio is

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.960
also under investigation

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.079
for crunch and difficult development management

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:14.599
at certain

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.240
Rockstar subsidiaries, particularly in the

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.960
Rockstar India studio.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.680
intensify between the star-studded firm

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.200
tek and inevitably Red Dead Online is

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.720
far from living up to the expectations and

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.560
promises of techou which have

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.760
unfortunately hyped fans even with the arrival of the

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.400
final version of Red Dead online in May

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.920
2019 on  service will never manage to

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.720
recover, sinking completely into

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.319
abandonment in 2021 the year 2019 will not be

00:37:36.319 --> 00:37:37.920
easy for Rockstar with a

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.480
very difficult development of the next

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.079
opus of the GTA series there again two

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:43.680
new conflicts opposing the visions of

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.640
Rockstar and  notably from Danhauser with

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.400
that of teekou many concerns

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.800
affect the writing of the game and its

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.720
scenario and finally on February 4, 2020

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.880
dan Hauser in turn decides to leave

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.680
the Rockstar ship this decision

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.280
was not planned and will also

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.119
do a lot  internal noise

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.920
both at the Rockstar studios

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.079
and at teekt strolljenck

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:04.680
moreover will refuse to address the departure

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.920
of Danhuser 2 days later during the

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.920
quarterly review with the investors

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.680
the departure of Dan will hurt and will

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.079
lead to d  other departures with

00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:14.520
many changes Jennifer Colby in

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.880
place for twenty years at

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.839
Rockstar takes her role as

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:19.920
vice-president the team of scriptwriters

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.599
of Rockstar and Dan Hauser does

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.800
not move from 5 members to four with

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.680
Michael  hworn who takes the role of

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.359
director of the written word sure over the

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:28.880
weeks many veterans who

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.280
have been at Rockstar for

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.760
many years will leave the

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.359
different studios of the star

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:35.280
tech firm while on his side is making big

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.880
changes to straighten out the ranks

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.440
following multiple investigations carried out

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.040
by journalists under the

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.800
working conditions within Rockstar studios,

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.319
studio directors are thus

00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:45.280
thanked, other veterans in

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.839
turn leave their position not being in

00:38:46.839 --> 00:38:48.400
line with the new

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.280
teek2 processes in addition to the  many unpublicized departures

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.040
but still very

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.119
important since most of these

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.480
people were

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.480
senior developers with a lot of

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.040
big name experience also leaves Rockstar

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.160
as lasl Jones the producer of

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.800
almost all Rockstar games since

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.839
GTA 3 and unfortunately all this is going

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.520
end up feeling more and more

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.480
about Rockstar's way of doing things as the

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.359
months go by, early fans

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:11.040
realize that a rather

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.800
worrying change is starting to affect the

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.960
star farm and the announcements of future games

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.200
will not reassure  in June 2020

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.160
Rockstar announces an extended and

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.200
improved version of GTA V planned for 2021 on

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.800
PS5 and Xbox series

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:30.520
ps5 event and

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.680
that the development of this

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.560
negen version will actually begin after its

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.800
announcement in October 2021 several leaks

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.079
seem to confirm the arrival of a

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:41.480
remake version of GTA trilogy on PC and

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.680
console and finally Rockstar will

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.160
leak the whole thing itself

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.920
information with the new logos and

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.240
artworks on its Social Club following

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.720
this GTA trilogy fiasco the final

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.800
edition is finally announced and

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.839
confirmed the game will arrive a month

00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:57.720
later in a disastrous state

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.839
with a launch which for once can

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:01.720
be  compared to that of cyberpunk the

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.599
PC versions will even be withdrawn from

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:05.480
sales and PC players who have purchased

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.240
their version will simply no

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.200
longer have access to it for more than 24 hours because

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.119
confidential files of the

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.839
highest importance have been left in

00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:14.440
the source codes  of the game and therefore

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.400
easily accessible to people

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.880
with a minimum of knowledge on PS5

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.240
and Xbox series the games are barely

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.880
playable with a slew of funny bugs

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.640
but not really annoying on PS4 Xbox and

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.800
switch on the other hand it is unplayable with

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.760
numerous crashes and  it is an

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.680
unspeakable disaster for the

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.040
development of this definitive

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.760
edition Rockstar called on an

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.200
external service provider with whom they have

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.839
already worked on the mobile ports

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.960
of Buouly or Max Pain this

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.960
service provider is group Street Games and

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.200
the  base GTA trilogies of definitive

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.400
edition was planned on PC console and

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.720
mobile for the beginning of 2022

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.280
but following the postponement of GTA V negen the

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.280
projects were reversed and GTA trilogy

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.280
finally found itself released for

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.240
November 2021 thing to  which the

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.760
Street Games group teams were

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.680
clearly not prepared and the

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.480
workload was far too heavy for

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.640
this modest studio so is it a lack

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.400
of communication on the part of the studio

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.160
a negligence of Rockstar who did not

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.480
pay attention  a total absence of

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.680
quality assurance testing difficult to say to

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.280
date but the observation remains that the

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.000
release of GTA the trilogy the first

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.119
project after the departure of Danhuser and

00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:21.480
a large part of the

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.839
Rockstar teams is a total failure

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:25.319
undoubtedly the biggest failure in

00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:27.079
Rockstar history, the

00:41:27.079 --> 00:41:28.520
mobile versions which were expected for early

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.119
2022 are finally postponed to December

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:33.560
2023 and it is the Netflix

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.440
Games teams who will develop the game since

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.440
Grove Street Games has obviously been

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.520
withdrawn from the project  in this same period

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.640
GTA San Andreas ver is announced by Mark

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.680
Zuckenberg during a

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.880
Metta Quest conference to be released later on the

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.640
Quest 2 2 years later still no

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.040
news of the project in parallel teek2

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.480
continues the promotion of the new

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.319
version  of GTA V assuring fans and

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:56.440
investors that Rockstar is preparing

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.720
much more than a simple port on PS5

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.119
and Xbox series finally after

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.280
almost 2 years of waiting for a simple

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.079
port GTA V arrives in March 2022 on

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:07.960
NextGen consoles and we do not  we

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.960
had nothing more than a simple port of

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.400
the PC version on NextGen console

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.560
moreover at the time of its release this

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.640
reissue of GTA V completely lost its

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.359
extended and improved mention

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:21.599
once again stroszelnick as with redad

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:23.640
online will have sold a dream  to the fans in

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.240
August 2023 it is via new Fues ex

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.559
exactly the same as 2 years earlier

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:29.440
with GTA Z trilogy that the port of

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.839
Red Dead Redemption on PS4 and switch li

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:33.760
on the Social Club visibly the

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.559
star firm no longer learns from  its errors and

00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:37.559
once again the game is announced in a

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:39.760
hurry a few hours after the link

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.640
with once again many

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.680
questions about the usefulness of the project

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.800
why a simple port and not a

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.720
real remake why not release the

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.280
game on PC which  never arrived on

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.319
this platform, again

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:53.280
relevant questions but which will remain

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.400
unanswered at the end of summer 2023,

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.240
i.e. 3 years after the departure of Dan Hauser,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.480
a large part of the

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.400
important members of Rockstar, the star-studded firm

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.200
remains  out of 5 announcements with GTA V NextGen

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.280
in June 2020 GTA the trilogy and GTA San

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.960
Andreas green in October 2021 the next

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.240
GTA in February 2022 and the port of Red

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.440
Dead Redemption in August 2023 five

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.760
announcements and none notable out of these

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.280
five announcements three games are already

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.359
released with GTA the trilogy in November

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:23.559
2021 which was an unprecedented fiasco

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:26.319
GTA 5 in March 2022 which was acceptable

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:27.839
but very disappointing compared to what

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.359
we had been promised and redad

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.920
Redemption which kept all its

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.800
promises but which remained very disappointing

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.680
faced with the possibilities that we could have

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.680
had and the incomprehension of seeing

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.520
Rockstar Games, one of the most

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.800
important video game companies in the

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.760
world, releasing a remaster on PS4 in 2023

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.640
obviously all of this does not reassure because

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.440
we are now very far from the  Rockstar

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.400
of the 2000s who let

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.839
absolutely nothing leak and who made

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:53.720
no mistakes who even announced and

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.200
prepared a GTA V trailer quickly

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.839
with a model of Franklin which was

00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.880
not even final just for having suffered

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.720
an unauthorized intrusion into  its

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.640
servers and for fear of having the

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.800
game liquefied all hopes were now

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.760
focused on the next opus of the

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.200
GTA series and concerning this next GTA

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.359
precisely and well here again it starts

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.800
rather badly since the official announcement

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.160
of the game dates back to February 4  2022

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.880
via this press release published on

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.000
the Rockstar website and on Twitter in just

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.240
a few minutes this tweet

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.680
will become the most liked in the history of

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.640
Twitter in the gaming category and

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.480
only two small lines which

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.359
confirm that the next opus of GTA

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:31.440
is in  active development such a

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.640
disappointing announcement so far from the

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.319
GTA 5 logo which appears without warning on the

00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:37.559
Rockstar site early in the morning, far

00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:39.280
from the announcement of redad Redemption 2 on a

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.720
Sunday afternoon when no one

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.359
expected it, an announcement quite  what is

00:44:42.359 --> 00:44:44.680
most banal or rather a

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.640
pre-announcement because after all on this

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.800
February 4, 2022 the official name of the game

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.680
is not even revealed nor its logo and

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.640
no information is given

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.559
Rockstar just wanted to panic the web

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:56.040
a few  days of teek2's financial report

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.040
and it worked but the

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.359
conclusion remains the same and this

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:01.280
press release will go down in history as

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.599
the very first time of communication

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:05.040
around the next GTA chance or not it

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.800
will have been published on February 4, 2022, i.e. 2

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.520
years ago  to the day after the announcement of

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.319
Danhauser's departure on February 4, 2020 7

00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:14.599
months later on September 18, 2022

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:16.520
Rockstar suffers the worst leak in its

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.280
history more than 90 videos and 53 minutes

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.400
of rush are posted online

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.400
around this next GTA  the opportunity to

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.160
confirm the return to Vice City the

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.720
presence of Ann initial the two

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.400
main characters of the game but also

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.880
to discover numerous tests and

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.559
features which we do not even know

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:33.040
if they will be in the final version of the

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.839
game teekou immediately seized the  FBI

00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:37.839
who took only 5 days to find

00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:39.319
the young 17-year-old teenager

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:41.359
responsible for this hack who

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:43.319
subsequently threatened Rockstar to release

00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:44.520
other ultra-

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.839
confidential information such as the source codes

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:48.079
of GTA V, GTA online or even GTA

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.599
6 in just  2 years after the departure of

00:45:50.599 --> 00:45:52.920
danhuser Rockstar had already suffered its

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.680
worst game launch in its history

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.720
with GTA the trilogy and the biggest

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.160
failure in its history with the leagues of

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.280
this next GTA and according to certain rumors

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.160
in the corridors the announcement of the new GTA

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.480
was scheduled for the end of 2022 and the

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.280
latter would have been postponed to 2023

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.119
following these links the morale of the

00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:09.720
Rockstar teams was at its lowest and the new

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.000
objective was to get everyone

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.599
to agree with a trailer which would not have

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:15.680
made any  debate in September 2023,

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.599
one year after the elique on the occasion of the 10th

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:19.640
anniversary of GTA V Rockstar begins its

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.079
strange communication which will

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:22.760
literally return to the Internet

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.200
every week by publishing the new

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.000
releases of GTA online with

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.359
allusions to the Roman numeral 6 could

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:30.400
be found then depending on the images of

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.160
course this could be more or less

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.839
obvious but knowing that behind

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.319
each publication there is a

00:46:35.319 --> 00:46:37.640
specialized communications team which checks

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.440
everything and it is difficult to see it as a

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.040
coincidence since nothing is left

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.400
randomly with Rockstar of course the star-

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.160
studded firm prepared fans for

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.880
the announcement that we were all waiting for but

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.480
finally after a month and a half of

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.839
teasing it was on November 8, 2023 that

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:53.079
the announcement dropped the first trailer for the

00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:55.920
next opus of  GTA will be released at the

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.599
beginning of December and again

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.960
the hype is unprecedented in a few

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.920
minutes the tweet once again becomes

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.440
the most liked tweet in the history

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.880
of Twitter in the gaming category and

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.480
in 10 days there are more than  180 million

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.400
impressions which were made by this

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.559
unprecedented tweet and yet here again

00:47:13.559 --> 00:47:15.559
the communication is ultra disappointing and

00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:17.160
simplistic and the concerns

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.720
were starting to become more and more

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.559
numerous so this is the new

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.119
Rockstar a company which no

00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:23.599
longer left  room for the surprise announcing

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:25.160
their most anticipated games in

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.440
history in such a banal way and well

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.480
you have to believe that yes on December 1,

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.079
2023 Rockstar keeps its word and confirms

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.960
the arrival of the next GTA on December 5

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.200
at 3 p.m. French time and there  another

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.040
simple tweet without text just an image

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.760
which inevitably reminds us of Vice City

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.800
with the Rockstar logo the date and

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.280
time of publication of trailer 1

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.319
is enough to literally set the web ablaze

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.640
with nearly 2 million likes in 24

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.960
hours and more than  200 million views

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.800
and impressions in this same period,

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.599
completely crazy but also

00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:01.640
terribly frustrating by the simple

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.760
fact of wanting to please

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.680
investors on November 8 Rockstar

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.079
ruined this surprise effect,

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:08.760
just imagine the surprise effect if this

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.800
image had been  published this December 1st

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.000
without the tweet of November 8th that was

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.920
the Rockstar before it was that for GTA

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.319
V and for redad Redemption 2 but in the

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:20.599
end even if it was a little frustrating and

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:22.520
disappointing for the fans the hype is

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.920
still there because again like in

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.680
2018 a large part of the

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.359
video game industry uses Rockstar's announcement

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:29.200
to parody it the manufacturers

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.920
react on Rockstar's page and

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.119
share the information the entire

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:36.000
video game industry is concerned and  I'm

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.480
impatiently waiting for December 5th and this

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.520
completely crazy craze, only

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.720
Rockstar is capable of

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.400
doing it and if ultimately this was the

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.960
new Rockstar, no more room for the

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.200
eccentric and the surprise but

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.119
now for something  simple to

00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:53.359
basic but which works in the image of

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:55.680
Tech2 the parent company and the businessmen

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.040
and this beginning of communication around

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.079
this new GTA would this evolution of

00:48:59.079 --> 00:49:00.839
Rockstar not be a taste

00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:03.079
and well precisely of this next opus a

00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:05.520
game in the  the spirit of the times which is changing after

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.920
all Daner said it so well in 2018 that

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.000
now with our society and

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.079
current policies it was difficult

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:14.119
to make satire and if this next

00:49:14.119 --> 00:49:16.760
GTA lost this satirical side and if

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.000
censorship came to spoil the game it  is

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.319
undeniable that we have the right

00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:22.480
to be worried the departure of Danhauser

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.520
overnight says a lot let us remember

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.960
that he still cond F this

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.440
company with his brother remember

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.079
that he was there from the beginning that he

00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:30.400
worked on all Rockstar games

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.720
since 1998 and until 2020 to push

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.880
a man to abandon his company in the

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.200
middle of the development of the most

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.920
anticipated game in history is that the

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.119
disagreements were necessarily important

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:42.920
worse still to see that his  replacing

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.319
Michael hwor also abandons

00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.720
ship and this same position of

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.000
writing director 2 years later means that there are

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.359
really major concerns to be

00:49:51.359 --> 00:49:52.760
had in terms of the writing of the

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.200
scenario and the themes that will be

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.960
addressed  in this next GTA we must

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.760
face the facts that the Rockstar

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.599
Games that we knew no longer exist,

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.880
the anarchist Rockstar who was

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.839
not afraid of anyone who feared no one and

00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:05.400
who continued the trials because they

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.160
were convinced of winning them this

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.359
Rockstar no longer exists, sold off, is

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:11.599
transformed by a teekto which is

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:13.640
now trying to be the perfect company,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.720
the problem is that you can't

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.200
have the perfect image when you

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.160
own Rockstar, a company which

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.440
based its image on the bad boy side  and

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.400
yet Rockstar

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.760
's much wiser and much more careful communication

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.720
in recent years is

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.960
proof of this: announcing the new GTA on

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.319
February 4, 2022, i.e. 2 or 3 days before the

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:32.520
quarterly review with investors

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.400
announced the first trailer of the game on

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.680
November 8, i.e. there  still a few hours

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.480
before the new quarterly report with

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.720
investors removing the

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.119
Confederate flag in GTA trilogy removing

00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:44.960
transgender NPCs and

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.640
gay superhero toys in the new version

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.920
of GTA V on NextGen all these little

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.760
signs are rising that teek to no longer wants

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.920
to  history and at the end of 2023

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.000
and the beginning of 2024 can we

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.160
really want to attack everything these

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.520
days everything is taking on

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.680
completely crazy proportions on

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.359
social networks and even if Rockstar was

00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:02.960
attacked for transformed content with

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.200
transant PNGs in GTA V they would have

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.960
won the case hands down given

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.160
that GTA V is a sathyr and that the entire

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.520
population of Los Santos is mocked

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.319
whether it is the rich the gangsters the

00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:15.440
transgender characters the same with GTA

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.720
4 and the many  rabins or

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.480
Asians who were two

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.559
very stereotypical communities in Liberty City

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:22.200
moreover it would not be surprising to

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.960
see the transor associations which

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.720
requested the withdrawal of the P sofusquer and

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.480
criticized in the next GTA for

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.440
setting them apart if in this next GTA  there are

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.680
no transgender NPCs the strength of

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.440
GTA is to put everyone in

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.119
the same bag and make fun of

00:51:36.119 --> 00:51:38.200
everyone whether it's minorities or

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.119
any community but

00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:41.880
always in an intelligent and  to

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.720
denounce necessarily for the NPCs it is

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.599
to make fun of our current society

00:51:46.599 --> 00:51:48.559
and magnifying the features of each

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:50.280
category of person but in the

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.280
missions the stories of GTA Rockstar has

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.920
never stirred up hatred quite the

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.839
contrary at a time when players  who

00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:57.920
think they are fans and connoisseurs of Rockstar,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.760
criticizing them for becoming Rostar Games,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.440
many forget that GTA San Andreas

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.040
was one of the very first

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.000
big budget games in history to only offer

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.079
a cast of black or

00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:09.760
colored characters and that the  only

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.680
white characters were often antagonists

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.920
or fans of the game many forget

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.760
that a transgent character was at the

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.880
center of many

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.720
main missions in gta vice city stories

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.359
with runy wasin Mayer the presenter

00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:24.160
of Flash FM who was close to vigv the

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.599
main character of the game  in GTA 4

00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:28.760
niikobellic must defend Florient alias

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.079
Berny a gay character who is

00:52:31.079 --> 00:52:32.880
misled by executioners and what about

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.720
GTA the ballad of Gony where we play

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.200
Luis Lopez a Hispanic and

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.359
bodyguard of Tony prince the night king in

00:52:40.359 --> 00:52:43.160
Liberty  City and who is completely gay

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.160
imagine if this DLC had been released in 2023

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.240
or if a similar DLC arrived on GTA

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.960
VI many take the example of GTA V

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.760
forgetting that Trevor is bisexual and

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.200
that he has the habit of crossing himself

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.200
estir Rockstar does not  never waited for

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.000
it to be trendy to highlight

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.079
minorities, quite the contrary, but in

00:53:01.079 --> 00:53:03.559
2023 inevitably the transent NPCs

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:05.359
were removed following a complaint from an

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:07.040
association because even if the trial was

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.839
won in advance it could have taken

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:10.400
time.  completely crazy scales with

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.040
social networks since today

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.599
many people are offended for

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.520
nothing forgetting the real fights and

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.480
often offend to create false

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.880
dramas so can we really want

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.839
teekou to want to calm down and

00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:23.839
want to avoid any overflow of  'on the one

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.440
hand yes because it is ro St and C GTA and

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.440
the fans know that it is a Sayre

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.319
and a parody of our world and

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:32.440
our current society but on the other

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.359
hand teekou remains a  company of

00:53:34.359 --> 00:53:36.160
businessmen with interests and

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.440
inevitably will seek to

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.280
defend them censorship is therefore half

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.839
justified from this point of view and

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:42.520
satire becomes almost impossible in

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.160
2024 unfortunately the result is

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.599
terrible since we gradually see

00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:48.079
extinguish the Rockstar that we have

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:49.880
always known and the Rockstar that

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.760
will have made us dream for so many years and

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.960
the worst the worst is that even if the

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.760
scenario of this next GTA is very

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.920
wise and therefore very bad compared to

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.920
all the  others and well almost more than the

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.599
r/4 of the players will not

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:03.839
realize it except the fans of the first

00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:05.640
hour who know by heart all the

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.960
opuses of GTA and the Rockstar games who

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.200
will immediately see that there is

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.760
a lot  less subtlety of

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.040
implication the other players the

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.319
a little casual casual players

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.359
those who just like GTA for its

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:19.680
freedom and the other players who don't

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.280
even watch the cutscenes or

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.160
who just play online and well those

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.400
they don't  will see it as fire either

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.079
because they don't care about the scenario

00:54:27.079 --> 00:54:28.760
or because in 10 years they will

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.280
not realize the change

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.960
knowing that GTA V was already much

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.000
wiser than GTA 4 or because quite

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.799
simply it will be enough  to have two or three

00:54:35.799 --> 00:54:37.319
sex scenes so that many

00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:39.079
say that we have not lost the Rockstar

00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:42.760
of before and yet Rockstar and GTA

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.240
are much more than two or three

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.400
sex scenes, they are extremely well

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.200
worked texts  it's subtleties,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.040
innuendoes that are sometimes difficult to understand,

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.839
it's jokes and barbs thrown at

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:53.480
politicians and

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.040
megalomaniac millionaires, it's also a denunciation of

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.559
our society, our policies and

00:54:57.559 --> 00:54:59.559
our networks, but that's not the case.  do

00:54:59.559 --> 00:55:01.720
n't even know today in the end and

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.720
it's terribly sad to say as long as

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.520
this next GTA will be extremely

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.480
beautiful as long as it will offer

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.240
solid content as long as it will offer an

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.440
extremely lively and bug-free world the game

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.680
will be a huge success  and that's it all

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.240
on Monday, December 4 at 3 p.m., just

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.000
24 hours before the publication of the trailer

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.480
Rockstar decides to create a

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.520
live first broadcast event so that the

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.119
video is posted online the next day

00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:29.799
as planned with a live broadcast

00:55:29.799 --> 00:55:31.920
from the first seconds  several

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.359
Internet users manage to find the

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:35.079
duration of the trailer in the video settings

00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:36.920
and of course this did not

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.760
bode well in the next

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.079
hours which would follow and in fact

00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:43.839
on Monday evening around 11:45 p.m. the entire

00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:45.960
trailer was posted on social networks

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.440
in abominable quality Rockstar and

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.960
techto did not delay and

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.240
instantly deleted the lilies and the account at

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.160
the origin of the leak but the damage was

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.760
done and everything spread very quickly on

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.839
the networks at midnight French time

00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:59.559
while December 5 was happening.  the tip of

00:55:59.559 --> 00:56:01.400
its nose and we entered the

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.280
last 15 hours of waiting the

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.480
official trailer of what we can

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.839
now call GTA 6 begins to

00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:08.680
spread on the web faced with this

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.599
crisis situation Rockstar decides to

00:56:10.599 --> 00:56:12.359
throw  the trailer at min 15

00:56:12.359 --> 00:56:15.960
French time i.e. 6:15 p.m. New York time

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.359
[Music]

00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:21.520
York and that's the slap we discover

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.839
a trailer as agreed of a minute 30

00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:25.640
which shows us the beauty and the

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.119
buff transcription of Miami or at

00:56:28.119 --> 00:56:29.920
least of Vice  City as well as the State

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.280
of Florida or again the state of

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.520
Leonida a trailer which will make

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.920
everyone agree without exception both on

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.960
the graphic and technical level but

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.680
also on the density of the non-

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.920
playable characters of the animals of the  traffic

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.480
and many other points the rage 9 engine

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.119
is sublime and the game seems to be

00:56:46.119 --> 00:56:48.960
completely crazy Lucia and the one who

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.039
seems to be Jason are even present

00:56:51.039 --> 00:56:52.799
throughout this course terribly

00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:56.000
intense preview as soon as it is published the trailer will

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.720
literally explode the Internet

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.400
millions of  views follow one another while

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.559
the video was published without warning

00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:03.440
the counter continues to rise, exceeding

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.960
10 million views in less than a

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.559
quarter of an hour the feedback is all

00:57:07.559 --> 00:57:09.359
unanimous and the world of pop culture

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.200
begins to  stop filming to only

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.480
talk about GTA 6 at the 24-hour Stock Exchange

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.039
the trailer is seen more than

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:18.920
90.6 million times, breaking no

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.920
less than three world records

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.720
officialized by the Guiznessbook of

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.599
Records including the video of the

00:57:24.599 --> 00:57:26.400
most  view of the history of YouTube in 24

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.680
hours the most liked video game video

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.160
in the history of YouTube in 24 hours of

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.599
broadcast and the

00:57:32.599 --> 00:57:34.400
most viewed video in the history of YouTube excluding

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.680
music videos the first trailer of  GTA

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.079
6 achieves the feat of reaching the top 3

00:57:39.079 --> 00:57:40.520
most viewed videos in the history

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.400
of YouTube during their first 24

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.960
hours of broadcast, becoming the only

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.400
non-music video video to appear in this

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.079
top 10 and therefore from the first

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.720
trailer  while it was published

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.319
in haste and

00:57:51.319 --> 00:57:53.599
total chaos Rockstar manages to make

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:55.480
history and launch the

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.480
GTA 6 phenomenon at the time of the release of the

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.119
trailer all the lights are green

00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.839
because the latter is beautiful the  game

00:58:00.839 --> 00:58:03.200
promises to be very complete and in addition we

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.039
really have the impression of seeing GTA of the

00:58:05.039 --> 00:58:07.720
real GTA of the caricature of the

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.599
improbable situations of the NPCs who seem

00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:11.400
completely crazy to be on the roof

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.240
of the cars running naked with the

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.920
cops on their trail or  by wanting to

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.839
fight with two hammers for all

00:58:16.839 --> 00:58:18.000
the people who were afraid this

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.920
first trailer is a relief because

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.920
obviously the star-studded firm has not

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.000
lost its satire unfortunately the first

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.240
ultra positive reactions which

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.440
already seem to affirm that GTA  6 will be an

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.559
excellent GTA is a first step

00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:32.720
towards the cyberpunk syndrome because yes

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.640
let's not forget that this remains a trailer

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.440
and even if from a certain point of view this

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.720
trailer is a Sayre that Rockstar has the

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.920
courage to dare this and to  offer one

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.760
of these craziest trailers in its

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.839
history let's not forget that all the

00:58:44.839 --> 00:58:46.280
craziest sequences are in

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.480
reality references to our society

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.240
with situations which have already

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.039
taken place in our very real world and

00:58:53.039 --> 00:58:55.039
here again it's  is beautiful since it

00:58:55.039 --> 00:58:57.160
directly reflected Dan Hauser's speech

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.599
in 2018 who said that it

00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:01.280
was becoming more and more complicated to

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.520
create Sayre with a society that

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.520
was becoming even more ridiculous than

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.359
satire itself and we want it  or

00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:09.000
no it is not in a trailer that

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.960
we will be able to judge or not the satire of the

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.000
game it is indeed as a whole in

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.760
its missions in the dialogues and the

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.520
narration that we will only be able to

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.680
realize if Rockstar  has not lost

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.760
its identity because through a trailer we

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.520
can convey any message

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.119
the example of cyberpunk a few

00:59:24.119 --> 00:59:26.319
seconds ago and the perfect example then it

00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:28.440
is essential to measure the hype and the

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.640
feedback because yes it is  undeniable that this

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.400
trailer is very positive and gives

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.119
a lot of hope for the continuation of this

00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:36.160
next GTA but no it would be a

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.039
serious error to think that this trailer

00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:39.920
alone confirms that Rockstar is

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.520
still the same company and that the

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.520
themes addressed in the  next GTA

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.839
will be as satirical critics and

00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:47.960
denunciators as its predecessors on

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.880
the technical side it is the same

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.520
although it is Rockstar and

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.440
on this point they have never disappointed,

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.760
only offering games even

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.160
more beautiful than  during their first

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.640
presentation, zero risk does not exist

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.799
and to avoid any hype and big

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.960
disappointment on arrival it is important

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.000
to qualify this hype so why the

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.520
cyberpunk syndrome and why fear

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.400
for this next GTA because after all

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.960
it is  true and we could see it with this

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.880
first trailer the game looks just

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.640
amazing powered by a rage 9 engine

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.680
which will once again slap

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.640
the entire video game industry in the face in

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.160
reality there is not much  to

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.039
fear for this next GTA and there is

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.440
very little chance that we will relive

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.680
a cyberpunk syndrome even if Rockstar has

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.359
made mistakes they still know

01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:32.240
how to communicate especially with this

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.079
type of game they will go all out

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:36.160
on the  com and offer a very

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.280
solid, complete, extremely beautiful solo game with an

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.000
online which for its part also risks

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.880
redefining the codes and everyone

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.280
will be happy, well, almost everyone

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.240
because here again for the fans of the

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.240
first hour the frustration risks

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.400
'be present but yes little

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.119
chance of things going wrong even

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.880
if be careful the zero risk N does

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.319
not exist teek can once again

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.400
be too greedy and on hyper the

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.960
fans as they did with realad

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.880
online or the  port of GTA V by

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.119
selling them things which will

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.480
perhaps not be in the final version of

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.799
this new GTA and then who knows never the

01:01:06.799 --> 01:01:08.720
game could end up buggy and there again it

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.680
would be a disaster but once again

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.160
little chance even if they

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.920
exist but as sad as the

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.920
reality is today the success of this

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.400
next GTA will not depend on its

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.599
scenario and its narration as long as the

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:21.640
game is beautiful, complete without bugs with

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.839
effective online it will be a success and not

01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:26.760
a small success  in reality it is even

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.880
almost certain that this next GTA will

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.880
be a historic success by destroying

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.440
everything in its path but it is

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.200
also certain that it will be the GTA which

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.119
will divide the most in history because

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:38.960
we are in 2024 well almost and

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.640
It will have been more than 10 years since the last

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.559
GTA was released and in 10 years

01:01:43.559 --> 01:01:45.559
social networks have become more democratic. Tell yourself

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:47.960
that in 2013 when GTA V was released Twitter

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.520
was just starting to make noise

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.240
and Facebook was at its peak

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.119
tell yourself that Instagram and Snapchat

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:54.920
had just been launched and that TikTok

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.520
did not exist in 10 years attendance

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.839
on social networks has exploded and in

01:01:59.839 --> 01:02:02.920
2024 there will be 10 times more people

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.400
who now give their opinion or who

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.920
simply  are looking to create

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.880
buzz by creating drama so it is

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.720
certain that this next GTA will divide

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.480
there will be early fans

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.839
who will inevitably start with a

01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:15.400
preconception and who will perhaps

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.160
influence themselves unconsciously from

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.480
today  by convincing themselves that it will be

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.200
worse than before, not letting even

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.279
the slightest chance and the slightest possible

01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:24.960
surprise surprise them, there will be

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.319
overly impatient fans who are waiting for

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:28.079
the game like Messi and who will have read

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:29.680
thousands of articles from the  thousands of

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.720
tweets and who will have listened to thousands

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.680
of videos and who will expect a

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.079
completely crazy game allowing them to

01:02:35.079 --> 01:02:36.680
do whatever they want in more

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.880
than 500 missions and who will ultimately

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.680
be disappointed because all of this will not be

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.520
in the  game they will have been deceived there

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.119
are also those who will love it but who

01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:45.680
will still take the game down on

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.680
Twitter to go against the tide and

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.400
create a buzz there are also those who will

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.119
find that Rockstar has become W by

01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:53.119
putting a  woman as a playable character

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:54.920
while 6 years earlier it was the

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.160
same people who cried because there was

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.839
no DLC with sad hadler in redad

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.240
Redemption 2 and then there are those who

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.599
will be disappointed because they waited too

01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:02.480
long in 10  years of waiting obviously

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.640
that the hype is gigantic and that we

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.960
can very easily be disappointed and finally there

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.319
will simply be those who

01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:10.319
will be really disappointed because whether we are

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:13.200
in 2024 or in 2013 one thing does

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.200
not change we have  all different opinions and tastes

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.480
and that's normal and it does

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.760
n't matter and so much the better so much the better because there will

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.000
also inevitably be those who

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.319
will love those who will discover GTA

01:03:23.319 --> 01:03:25.119
as many have discovered GTA with

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:27.920
GTA V between  2013 and 2023 and those

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.039
simply who have been fans since the

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:31.079
beginning and who will love and

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:32.640
have the best time in this

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.599
new GTA now a large part

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:36.680
of the maps are in the hands of

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.400
Rockstar and teek2 to avoid this

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.000
cyberpunk syndrome with

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.520
communication  totally transparent by

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.359
really showing us the game and its

01:03:44.359 --> 01:03:46.359
content without selling us the dream the

01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:47.880
press and the influencers also have

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.440
their role to play by avoiding

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.799
articles and videos putac click to

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:52.559
avoid selling the dream but on that

01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:54.240
it is already lost d  The balance

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.799
is also on the side of fans and

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:57.319
players who will have to moderate their

01:03:57.319 --> 01:03:59.359
expectations and pay attention to those who

01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:01.200
read and watch on the internet the

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.880
next GTA has just been revealed by

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.400
Rockstar and obviously it is difficult to

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.720
tell.  'be disappointed at the moment

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.520
the environment of VI City seems

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.400
gigantic with so many things to do

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.359
and discover if we must moderate our

01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:14.200
expectations to avoid being disappointed we must

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.680
also take a step back and not

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.760
condemn the game too early  even if so many

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.359
things can worry us in

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.039
recent years as mentioned a little

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:23.039
above this new GTA will inevitably

01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:25.920
divide and this will even be the GTA the

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.520
Rockstar game which will divide the most and

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.319
perhaps even the video game and the

01:04:30.319 --> 01:04:31.799
product  cultural which will also be the

01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:34.279
most divided and that does not matter there will

01:04:34.279 --> 01:04:35.880
inevitably be disappointed people and real

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.960
disappointed people and satisfied people who are truly

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.359
satisfied the importance is that everyone

01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:41.880
can form their own opinion and

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.960
appreciate their experience of  game as he

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.240
wishes without being influenced for

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.279
good or bad or without being judged and

01:04:48.279 --> 01:04:50.039
insulted we are now almost

01:04:50.039 --> 01:04:51.279
certain that the game will be a

01:04:51.279 --> 01:04:53.039
graphic and technical revolution and

01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:55.039
that is already an excellent thing and in the

01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.640
end even s  there have been many

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.240
worrying things in recent years

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.960
there are other reassuring things or

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.359
rather comforting things like

01:05:02.359 --> 01:05:04.440
the fact that this next GTA will be

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.240
the ultimate Rockstar game that we

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.319
all know even if the game has experienced

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:09.599
a  chaotic development and that it has

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:11.480
undergone two partial reboots and which has a

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.960
good chance that a large

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.039
part of the work of Danhuser or

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:16.400
other important members who

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.160
left has been cut from the game there will

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.240
even be a very small part 2  which

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.160
will perhaps make the difference after that it

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.000
will be finished the last pillar

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.359
will remain Sam Hauser whose future

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.319
also seems very uncertain in the event of

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:32.400
Sam's departure it is the whole soul of

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.480
Rockstar which will no longer exist so let

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.720
's take advantage of the  maximum of these

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.119
communication times of the next trailers of the

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:41.000
long months of waiting because this

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.880
next GTA could well be the

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.119
last game having a very small

01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:47.680
part of the soul of the Rockstar Games that

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.240
we all

01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:56.079
knew
